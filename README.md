# Helloed - a simple editor written in common lisp

### The features are:
- multithreaded syntax highlighting (for c files),
- opening file,
- saving file,
- search,
- rendering tabs

### The project uses 
- [cl-charms](https://github.com/HiTECNOLOGYs/cl-charms) (ncurses bindings),
- [cl-str](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-str) (helper functions for strings),
- [Bordeaux Threads](https://bordeaux-threads.common-lisp.dev/) (multithreading library)

### To run just load the file with your favourite common lisp implementation (I developed in sbcl).

###### This was a project to learn common lisp, so dont expect high quality of the code.
